# Call to Action

The `Call to Action` is the primary way to grab your users attention and move them to the next stage of their user journey

They can come in many forms depending on the situation. This is the most common version.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Split with Image" args={mocks}>
    {(args) => <Component {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Split with Image" />
