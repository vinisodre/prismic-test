# Contact

The `Contact` is the primary way to grab your users attention and move them to the next stage of their user journey

They can come in many forms depending on the situation. This is the most common version.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Contact" args={mocks}>
    {(args) => <Component {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Contact" />
