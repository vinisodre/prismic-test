# Featured Image Hero

Could we make the theme here a content relationship that allows the user to select an option from the CMS, which would be able to handle light & dark modes

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="FeaturedImageCenter" args={mocks}>
    {(args) => <Component {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="FeaturedImageCenter" />
